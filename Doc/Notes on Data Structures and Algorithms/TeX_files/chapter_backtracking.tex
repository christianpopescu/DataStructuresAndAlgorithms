\chapter{Backtracking}
\section{Problem's specification}

Pattern:

For a given problem we search all the sequences  $\bm{x_{1}x_{2} ... x_{n}}$ for which some property holds
 $\bm{P_n(x_{1},x_{2}, ..., x_{n})}$

\bigskip where: $\bm{x_k \in D_k}$ (some given domain of integers )

The backtrack method consists in designing "cutoff"/"bounding" properties $\bm{P_l(x_{1},x_{2}, ..., x_{l})}$ for $1\leq l \textless n$
