\chapter{Graph algorithms}
\section{Breadth-first search (BFS)}
The algorithm use a \textbf{Queue} to manage the gray/visiting vertices. 

\section{Depth-first search(DFS)}
The algorithm use a \textbf{Stack} to manage the vising vertices.

It could be implemented simple as recursive algorithm.

\section{Topological Sorting}

A \textbf{Topological Sorting} of a DAG is an linear ordering of its vertices such that for each vertice (u,v) in DAG the u appears before v in the ordering.


There are two known/classical algorithms for the Topological Sorting.

\subsection{TS with DFS}

Topological-Sorting(G)
1. Call DFS(G) to compute finishing time for each vertex.
2. When a vertex is finished inserted into a front of a linked list
3. Return the linked list of vertices.

\subsection{TS taking the vertex without inbound edge first}

1. Add all vertices without inbound edges to the ordered list
2. Remove from the graph these vertices's and the corresponding edges.
3. Repete steps 1 and 2 while there are vertices in the graph. If no vertices without inbount edges there is no solution.
